# Challenges

Answers for challenges for the book "Crafting Interpreteters".

## Chapter 1

1. Markdown, CSS, SCSS, SASS, HTML, Mustache.
2. Done.
3. That's my day job; so: done.

## Chapter 2

1. I wrote a mini-language for scatter-gather building before using Flex and Bison.
2. The burden of having to ship a full compiler for a runtime, and the compilation overhead itself during running.
3. Ease of implementation of the REPL, and for facilitating the user.

## Chapter 3

1. There's no multiple inheritance. This will probably very much complicate the language and introduce difficulties such as the dreaded diamond. Also, there are no constant values.
2. What are the default semantics for copying/moving? The answer is copying in the implementation, but it could be move semantics for a more efficient implementation. But this would inherently mean introducing C/C++-style references or pointers into the language.
3. Generics would be great, but this will hugely increase the complexity quite likely. Less costly would be the adding of convenience operators such as prefix/postfix in-/decrement like C and C++ have. The same holds for the compound assignment/arithmetic operators such as `+=`/`-=`/`*=`/`/=`. For system-programming domains bit operations and word-sized types would be beneficial.
